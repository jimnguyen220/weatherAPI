# weatherAPI
The goal of this project is to create a weather app using a weather API. When the page is loaded, you see a search bar.  Type in the city and that will append a button underneath a search bar.  When you type in another city, it adds that city to the list of previously searched cities.  When you click on the button for a previous result, it will display the current weather with a 5 day forecast.
